# Applied Mathematics for Engineers

This repository contains my solutions, mathematical derivations, and numerical implementations for **Applied Mathematics in Data Science**

Aims to bridge the gap between theoretical linear algebra and its practical application in **Machine Learning Engineering**.

## Structure

- `exercise_1/`: **Linear Algebra Foundations**
  - Vector norms and the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  - Solving systems of linear equations (Gaussian Elimination & LU Decomposition).
  - Hyperplanes and the Hessian Normal Form (SVM foundations).
- `exercise 2/`: upcoming

## Stack

- **Mathematics:** Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, Optimization.
- **Typesetting:** LaTeX (Local TeX Live environment).
- **Programming:** Python 3.x (NumPy for numerical verification).
- **Editor:** VSCodium with LaTeX Workshop.
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub.

## Reference & Literature

The problems and theoretical foundations are based on the textbook:

- **Burg, K., Haf, H., Wille, F., & Meister, A.** _Höhere Mathematik für Ingenieure, Band II: Lineare Algebra._ Springer Vieweg. [Link to Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-8348-2267-3)

This book provides a rigorous approach to vector spaces, which serves as the mathematical backbone for studies in Data Science.
